# Text Extraction and Recognition from an Image

**Dataset Used:-** TextOCR dataset

**Data Description:-**  The TextOCR dataset is a collection of images sourced from various sources containing textual content. The primary purpose of this dataset is to facilitate research and benchmarking in the field of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems. The dataset provides a diverse range of images with different text styles, fonts, sizes, orientations, and backgrounds to evaluate the performance of OCR algorithms under various conditions.

**My project focuses on:-**

1. Loading and visualizing image and annotation data.
2. Running two OCR engines: EasyOCR and Keras-OCR.
3. Drawing bounding boxes and text predictions on images.
4. Comparing results between both OCR models.

**Output**
